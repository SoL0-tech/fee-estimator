# VALR Blockchain Assessment Solution
## by Jared Murphy

### Overview

Implements the Fee Estimator API.

+ Hit `GET /` to retrieve list of API endpoints
+ Hit `GET /fee-estimate` to retrieve the fee estimates

**Note:** Averages will only appear after n blocks

### Running the app locally

1. From the project root, run `npm i` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run start` to start the server

### Running the tests

1. From the project root, run `npm i` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run test` to run the unit tests


Have tried to use sensible design patterns to implement and test the various components.
Didn't implement any of the bonus metrics, as they weren't strictly necessary and I didnt want
to spend more time than necessary on the assessment - I think this showcases enough.

Hope you find the code clean and nice-to-read!
